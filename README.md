# Checkers Game

A simple Checkers game implemented using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Game Description

Checkers is played on an 8x8 gameboard. A player can move one space diaganolly from their orginal position. If an opponents piece is one space in front of them diaganolly and the next space is open a player can 'jump' over their opponents piece taking it off the board. If there are multiple 'jumps' available a player must take them until they no longer can. A player wins when their opponent either has no more pieces or can no longer move their pieces.
